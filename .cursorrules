# Iterative Development Rules

## Language Policy

**All project content must be in English:**

- All code comments and docstrings must be written in English
- All documentation files (README.md, CHANGELOG.md, etc.) must be in English
- All commit messages must be in English
- All configuration file comments must be in English
- All error messages and log messages should be in English
- All variable names, function names, and class names should use English words (following Python naming conventions)

**Exceptions:**

- Proper nouns (brand names, product names, company names) should use their official/standard names (e.g., "Alibaba Cloud" is the official English brand name, not "阿里云")
- Test data or example values that are intentionally in other languages for testing purposes
- Strings that are explicitly designated as non-English content (e.g., translation files, language-specific prompts, multilingual content) should be preserved as-is, even if they contain mixed languages

**Enforcement:**

- Code reviews should verify compliance with this policy
- Pre-commit hooks or CI/CD pipelines can be configured to check for non-English content in code and documentation
- When adding new files or modifying existing ones, ensure all text content follows this policy
- If you encounter non-English content that should be translated, create a separate issue or PR to address it

**Guidelines for Contributors:**

- If you're not a native English speaker, don't worry - clear and simple English is preferred over complex grammar
- Use tools like spell checkers and grammar checkers if needed
- When in doubt, ask for review or use translation tools, but always have a native speaker or experienced contributor review the final text
- Focus on clarity and correctness over perfect grammar - the goal is effective communication

## Core Principles

1. **Independent commits for each small iteration**
   - Each complete small iteration must be immediately committed with git
   - Commit messages should clearly describe the content and impact of this iteration
   - Each iteration should be atomic and independently revertible

2. **Iteration completeness requirements**
   - After each iteration, the code must be able to run completely
   - Iterations must not break the integrity of existing functionality
   - If an iteration involves configuration changes, backward-compatible default values or clear error messages must be provided

3. **Iteration pace control**
   - After each iteration is completed, pause and wait for user instructions
   - Do not perform multiple iterations consecutively unless explicitly requested by the user
   - Before proceeding to the next step, ensure the current iteration has been tested and verified

4. **Feature protection**
   - Maintain existing functionality unchanged during refactoring
   - If breaking changes are necessary, provide migration guides
   - When converting hardcoded values to environment variables, default values or clear error messages must be provided

5. **Commit conventions**
   - Commit message format: `type(scope): description`
   - Clearly describe the content of this change
   - List environment variables or configuration items that need to be set
   - Explain backward compatibility
