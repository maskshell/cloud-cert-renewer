# Iterative Development Rules

## Core Principles

1. **Independent commits for each small iteration**
   - Each complete small iteration must be immediately committed with git
   - Commit messages should clearly describe the content and impact of this iteration
   - Each iteration should be atomic and independently revertible

2. **Iteration completeness requirements**
   - After each iteration, the code must be able to run completely
   - Iterations must not break the integrity of existing functionality
   - If an iteration involves configuration changes, backward-compatible default values or clear error messages must be provided

3. **Iteration pace control**
   - After each iteration is completed, pause and wait for user instructions
   - Do not perform multiple iterations consecutively unless explicitly requested by the user
   - Before proceeding to the next step, ensure the current iteration has been tested and verified

4. **Feature protection**
   - Maintain existing functionality unchanged during refactoring
   - If breaking changes are necessary, provide migration guides
   - When converting hardcoded values to environment variables, default values or clear error messages must be provided

5. **Commit conventions**
   - Commit message format: `type(scope): description`
   - Clearly describe the content of this change
   - List environment variables or configuration items that need to be set
   - Explain backward compatibility
